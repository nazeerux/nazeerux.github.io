                    2–3 focused design sessions

                    <h5> 1. Project Overview </h5>

                    This project explores a concept redesign of the hero section for a government-style e-Challan
                    portal.
                    The hero section is often the most critical point of entry, where users decide whether they
                    trust the platform enough to proceed—especially when payments are involved. <br>

                    The redesign focuses on clarity, trust, and ease of action, while maintaining an institutional
                    and official tone appropriate for public-service interfaces.

                    ⚠️ This is a concept project created for portfolio purposes.

                    <h5> 2. Problem Statement</h5>
                    <br>
                    Many public-service portals struggle with: Poor visual hierarchy Overloaded content in the first
                    screen Low trust perception for payment-related actions Unclear primary call-to-action As a
                    result, users feel hesitant, confused, or overwhelmed within the first few seconds of
                    landing on the page.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5> 3. Design Goals</h5>
                    <br>
                    Clearly communicate what the service does within seconds Guide users toward a single primary
                    action Establish trust without heavy or distracting elements Reduce cognitive load for
                    first-time users Maintain a calm, government-appropriate visual language
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5> 4. User Context & Assumptions</h5>
                    <br>
                    Primary Users
                    Vehicle owners checking challan status Users paying traffic fines online First-time users
                    unfamiliar with the process
                    User Needs
                    Quick understanding
                    Confidence in legitimacy
                    Simple, guided next steps

                    Because this is a concept project, insights are based on heuristic evaluation and patterns
                    commonly seen in public-sector UX.

                    <h5> 5. UX Strategy & Design Decisions</h5>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h6> a. Visual HierarchyThe hero section was structured to guide attention in this order:</h6>
                    Headline (what the service is)
                    Primary CTA (what to do next)
                    Supporting description
                    Trust indicators

                    Illustration

                    This ensures users understand the purpose before being asked to take action.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h6> b. Content Simplification</h6>

                    Reduced text to essentials only
                    Avoided technical jargon
                    Used instructional, plain language
                    This allows users to scan and act quickly.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h6> c. Trust & Credibility Signals</h6>

                    To reduce hesitation:
                    Included short trust statements (secure payments, official service, receipts)
                    Added usage/coverage indicators to reinforce legitimacy
                    Avoided emojis or decorative elements to keep tone formal
                    Trust cues were kept subtle, not promotional.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h6> d. Illustration Treatment</h6>
                    Used a contextual illustration related to traffic enforcement
                    Reduced illustration opacity to 85%
                    Ensured text and CTA always dominate visually
                    The illustration supports understanding without competing for attention.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h6> e. Color & Depth </h6>

                    Chose a blue and white palette to communicate trust, calm, and reliability
                    Used white space to improve readability
                    Added subtle depth using HSL-based lightness and saturation adjustments instead of heavy shadows
                    This created a soft 3D feel while keeping the interface clean and professional.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h6> f. Grid & Spacing System</h6>
                    Applied a consistent column grid
                    Used an 8px spacing system for layout rhythm
                    Ensured clean alignment across text, CTAs, and stats
                    This improves scannability and developer handoff.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h6> g. Accessibility Considerations</h6>

                    Adequate color contrast
                    Readable font sizes and line heights
                    Clear button labels
                    No reliance on color alone to convey meaning
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>7. Final Outcome</h5>

                    The redesigned hero section:
                    Communicates purpose within seconds
                    Feels trustworthy and official
                    Reduces cognitive load
                    Guides users toward action clearly
                    Aligns with real-world government UI standards
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>8. Learnings & Reflections</h5>
                    In public-service UX, restraint matters more than visual flair
                    Trust signals are as important as functional clarity
                    A strong hero section can significantly improve user confidence
                    Small details (spacing, opacity, hierarchy) have large UX impact
                    If extended further, this project could include:
                    Full user flow for challan checking and payment
                    Error states and edge cases
                    Mobile-first optimization
                    Usability testing with real users
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>9. Why This Project Matters</h5>

                    This case study demonstrates my approach to:
                    UX thinking and hierarchy
                    Designing for trust-sensitive flows
                    Government / institutional UI patterns

                <h4>ESY Ration App – UX Case Study</h4>
                <p>
                    The ESY Ration App is a mobile application concept designed to help users
                    easily access and manage their monthly ration allotments. The goal was to
                    create a simple, trustworthy, and user-friendly experience.
                </p>

                <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
                <p>
                    Existing ration systems are often confusing due to cluttered interfaces,
                    poor hierarchy, and unclear navigation. Users struggle to quickly find
                    their ration details and monthly allotments.
                </p>

                <h5>Project Goal</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Present essential information clearly</li>

                    <li>General public users</li>
                    <li>Families relying on ration services</li>
                    <li>Users with limited digital literacy</li>
                    <li>Low to mid-range smartphone users</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Tools Used</h5>
                <p>Figma</p>

                <h5>Design Approach</h5>

                <h6>Simplicity First</h6>
                <p>
                    The interface focuses on minimal design, avoiding unnecessary elements and
                    keeping interactions straightforward.
                </p>

                <h6>Clear Information Hierarchy</h6>
                <p>
                    Important information such as user details and monthly allotment is placed
                    at the top using card-based layouts.
                </p>

                <h6>Familiar UI Patterns</h6>
                <p>
                    Common mobile patterns like cards, bottom navigation, and clear CTAs were
                    used to reduce the learning curve.
                </p>

                <h6>Color & Accessibility</h6>
                <p>
                    A green-based color palette was chosen to represent trust, reliability,
                    and government-style utility applications.
                </p>

                <h5>Key Screens Designed</h5>

                </ul>

                <h5>UX Decisions</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used cards instead of long text for better scanning</li>
                    <li>Limited actions per screen to avoid confusion</li>
                    <li>Maintained consistent spacing and typography</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Challenges</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing for users with low digital familiarity</li>
                    <li>Avoiding information overload</li>
                    <li>Balancing simplicity with completeness</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Outcome</h5>
                <p>
                    The final design delivers a clear and accessible interface suitable for
                    MVP-level implementation and real-world use.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Clear hierarchy improves usability more than visual effects</li>
                    <li>Simple UI decisions create better experiences</li>
                    <li>Designing for real users improves outcomes</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Future Improvements</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>User testing with real users</li>
